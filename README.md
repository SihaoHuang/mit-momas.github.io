# The Mathematics of Multi-Agent Systems

## Course description

Computer AIs can now play Dota, Starcraft, and Go better than nearly any human being. But have you ever wondered what happens when dozens, hundreds, or millions of these intelligent agents face off against each other? This is not a hypothetical question: many phenomena in the social world, from financial market action to international relations, are formed by the interaction of sophisticated entities. In this course, we will go through the basics of how computers make decisions and learn, building up to an introduction to reinforcement learning. We will discuss insights from game theory and behavioral economics to connect them to human decision-making. Finally, we will talk about how these tools can be used to study complex systems like networks and supply chains, where we see the emergence of collective behaviors like systemic risks.

### Lecture 1 
What is a multi-agent system? We start with an outline of the course, followed by an intro to reinforcement learning to model a single agent's ability to learn by interacting with its environment.

### Lecture 4
How do two or more interacting agents learn? We introduce game theory as a tool for studying multi-agent decision problems with applications to cooperation and the enforcement of social norms.

### Lecture 5
How do we model networks of interacting agents? We use concepts from graph theory to answer questions about social influence, network formation, and multi-agent games.
