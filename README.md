MIT HSSP 2022: The Mathematics of Multi-Agent Systems
--

## Course description

Computer AIs can now play Dota, Starcraft, and Go better than nearly any human being. But have you ever wondered what happens when dozens, hundreds, or millions of these intelligent agents face off each other? This is not a hypothetical question: many phenomena in the social world, from financial market action to international relations, are formed by the interaction of sophisticated entities. In this course, we will go through the basics of how computers make decisions and learn, building up to an introduction to reinforcement learning. We will discuss insights from game theory and behavioral economics to connect them to human decision-making. Finally, we will talk about how these tools can be used to study complex systems like networks and supply chains, where we see the emergence of collective behaviors like systemic risks.
